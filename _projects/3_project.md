Mechanical metamaterials offer exceptional properties like high strength-to-weight ratios and enhanced energy absorption. However, localized stress concentrations remain a challenge, especially in additively manufactured geometries. 

In this project, we developed a bioinspired design optimization framework using the Maximum Material Utilization (MMU) metric to achieve uniform stress distribution across metamaterial geometries. Starting from an initial conceptual design, we optimized size and shape-size in two planar auxetic metamaterials, achieving uniform stress distribution at both microstructural and material levels.

Numerical simulations and experimental results demonstrated the framework's effectiveness, with optimized lattices showing superior energy absorption in dynamic impact tests compared to unoptimized designs. This work advances stress-based design optimization for robust, lightweight metamaterials.
