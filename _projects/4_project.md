In a auxetic structure, a longitudinal expansion results in a lateral expansion and a longitudinal compression results in the same laterally. Due to such a behavior, they possess a negative Poissonâ€™s ratio and exhibit an overall volumetric expansion/compression. 

This project leverages auxetic beam structures to improve load-bearing performance. Through Finite Element Modeling, we developed two designs: Oriented Re-entrant Structures (ORS) and Assorted Re-entrant Structures (ARS). By strategically orienting and clustering auxetic units, these designs achieved a 64% reduction in mass while enhancing deflection capabilities compared to standard beams.

In application, ARS beams were incorporated into a lightweight footbridge design, demonstrating superior deformation control and material efficiency over conventional cross beams. This work underscores the potential of auxetic metamaterials for sustainable, high-performance structural applications.
